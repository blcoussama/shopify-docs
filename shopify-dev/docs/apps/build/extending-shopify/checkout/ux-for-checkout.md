# UX for checkout

Checkout is the most critical step of the customer journey. Checkout should help customers feel in control and confident about their purchases. Use our UX guidelines when you're designing your checkout experiences to ensure that they're trustworthy, efficient, and considerate.

**Note**
Checkout apps and extensions have design requirements that apply to custom apps as well as public apps. Be sure that your app meets all requirements for its functionality and distribution type.

## Maintain trust

Customers should understand why they need to input personal information, and what will happen when they take an action. This builds trust between a customer and the merchant.

**Example**: Make it clear if an item costs money. Customers could miss this information if it's hidden among other content.

An example what not to do, which shows a gift wrapping option where the price is included in the description. An example of what to do for this scenario, where the price for the gift wrapping option displays clearly next to the button for adding this option

**Example**: When checking out requires the customer to supply personal information, let them know why.

An example of what not to do, which shows a request for the customer date of birth. An example of what to do for this scenario, where the UI indicates that date of birth is required to purchase alcohol

## Reduce friction

Friction in checkout can have an impact on checkout conversion. To reduce friction, localize your experiences, write effective content, and only show components when you know that customers need them.

**Note**
Localization is only supported for checkout UI extensions. Localization for post-purchase extensions isn't supported. Shopify Functions also have support for localization.

**Example**: Show options when you know that customers need them.

**Example**: Help customers understand what's optional.

## Test different scenarios

Although you might use a desktop while developing, the majority of customers make purchases on mobile devices. Many customers also use accelerated checkout options, like Shop Pay, which pre-fill the checkout with vaulted information. Test your extension to ensure that it behaves as desired in these scenarios.

The following are some examples that you can test for:

- Mobile and desktop
- Guest checkout and Shop Pay
- Physical, digital, and discounted products
- Ship and pickup delivery methods

**Example**: Checkout UI extension targets might change location between guest checkout and Shop Pay.
