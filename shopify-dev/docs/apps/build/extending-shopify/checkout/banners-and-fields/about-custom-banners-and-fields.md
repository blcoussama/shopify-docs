This guide introduces custom banners and fields, and describes the resources that you can use to build them in Shopify checkout.

## How it works

You can build functionality in your app that allows merchants to display and configure the following experiences:

## Custom banners

A custom banner is a notice that you can display to customers. For example, you might want to show a banner that indicates that items are final sale and can't be returned or exchanged. You can use a UI extension to build a custom banner.

You can support static targets so that extensions can be rendered using the checkout editor in one of the supported locations in checkout.

The following example shows how to display a banner that renders at the purchase.checkout.block.render target.
