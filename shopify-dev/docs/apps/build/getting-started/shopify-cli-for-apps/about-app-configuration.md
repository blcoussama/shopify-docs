# App configuration

You can configure your apps locally with TOML files, then link them to apps in your Partner Dashboard and deploy your changes using Shopify CLI. You can also configure most of this configuration through the Partner Dashboard. The configuration in the Partner Dashboard always reflects the active version of your app.

**Note:** For app configuration changes to take effect, you need to run the deploy command.

Learn more about managing app configuration files.

**Caution:** The shopify app config push Shopify CLI command is no longer supported. If you're using this command in your workflow, follow these steps to update app configuration with the deploy command.

## Reference

### Global

**Note:** For app configuration changes to take effect, you need to run the deploy command.

|----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| name | Yes | string | The name of your app. |
| handle | No | string | The URL slug of your app home, for example https://admin.shopify.com/store/your-store-name/apps/your-app-handle/app. **Warning:** Updating the handle changes the admin URL that appears when you access your app from the side menu. As a result, any embedded app admin links will be broken. |
| client_id | Yes | string | The app's public identifier. |
| application_url | Yes | string matching a valid URL | The URL of your app. **Note:** If you're building an extension-only app, then your application_url will be set to https://shopify.dev/apps/default-app-home by default. |
| embedded | Yes | boolean | Embedded apps let users interact with your app without leaving the context of Shopify. |
| extension_directories | No | array of string paths or glob patterns | The paths that Shopify CLI will search for app extensions. When omitted, defaults to ["extensions/"]. |
| web_directories | No | array of string paths or glob patterns | The paths that Shopify CLI will search for the web files of your app. When omitted, defaults to the app root directory. |

### access_scopes

Define the permissions your app requests, as well as how the permissions are requested.

**Note:** For app configuration changes to take effect, you need to run the deploy command.

| Property | Required? | Value | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| scopes | Yes | string matching a comma-separated list of scopes | Any access scopes that your app will request access to during the authorization process.

| optional_scopes | No | array of string access scopes | Any access scopes that your app can request dynamically after installation. Learn how to manage access scopes for your app. |
| use_legacy_install_flow | No | boolean | When omitted or false, scopes are saved in your app's configuration, and are automatically requested when the app is installed on a store or when you update the scopes value. This is referred to as Shopify managed installation. When true, the legacy installation flow requests scopes through a URL parameter during the OAuth flow. The legacy installation flow is still supported, but isn't recommended because your app can end up with different scopes for each installation. |

## Migrate from config push

The shopify app config push Shopify CLI command is no longer supported. Instead, you can release your app configuration and extensions together with the deploy command.

### Migrate interactively

If you use the shopify app config push command without the --force flag, then follow these steps to migrate to the deploy command:

1. Upgrade Shopify CLI to the latest version.
2. Remove all references to the shopify app config push command in any scripts or aliases.
3. When you're ready to deploy both app configuration and all extensions, run the deploy command.

**Terminal**
```bash
shopify app deploy
```

4. Shopify CLI will ask if you want to start including app configuration on deploy. Answer Yes, always, and your choice will be saved in your app configuration file.
5. Continue the rest of the deploy flow to release a new app version to users.
6. Push your app configuration file to source control, so all contributors use the same app configuration. This ensures that the app and Shopify CLI commands behave the same way in each contributor's environment.

### Update your CI/CD workflow

If you use the shopify app config push with the --force flag, follow these steps to migrate to the deploy command:

1. Upgrade Shopify CLI to the latest version.
2. Remove all references to the shopify app config push command.
3. Add the line `include_config_on_deploy = true` to the [build] section in your app configuration file. Once set, both app configuration and extensions will be included when you deploy.

**üìÅ shopify.app.config-name.toml**
```toml
[build]
include_config_on_deploy = true
```

4. Add the deploy command with the --force flag to your workflow, if it's not there already. Refer to the example workflows for more details.
