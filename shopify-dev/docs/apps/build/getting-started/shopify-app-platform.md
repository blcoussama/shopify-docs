## Meeting Merchant Needs

Shopify itself meets about 80% of global merchant needs. For everything else, Shopify merchants turn to apps.

Successful apps solve merchant problems better than their competitors. Very successful apps solve problems that no one else has attempted.

## Best Practices

Make your app more accessible, secure, and performant.

### Quality from the Start

Keep Shopify App Store requirements in mind as you build.

### Deployment and Distribution

Deploy to the Shopify App Store to reach millions of merchants, or directly to a single organization for targeted impact.

## Selling Made Easy

Put the Shopify App Store to work for you. With a trove of business intelligence, the platform sells your app to the right audience from among Shopify's millions of merchants.

## A Deeper Look at Data

Optimize user experience and get real-time data by building data connections

### App Configuration

Add data integrations as you architect your app

### APIs for Commerce

With Shopify APIs, your app can integrate data with Shopify in real time

### Custom Data

Boost performance by storing custom data on Shopify

### Webhooks

Get notified about events on a store by subscribing to webhook topics

## Apps and Their Extensions

An app's centralized pages—the app home—and its backend are hosted externally. Meanwhile, an app's extensions are hosted by Shopify and rendered with native technologies.
